# Overview 
<p align="justify">
In order to fully appreciate the context in which some of these were written, I humbly request you take note of the dates these articles were authored. At the time these were written many of the malware techniques described were not in the public domain. In the years following the publication of these articles some of the techniques highlighted have been implemented in sophisticated malware used by either nation states actors or cyber criminal organizations. Many of these articles illustrate the absolute need to defend against attacks on critical infrastructures such as electrical power and telecommunications we all rely on.
   
The U.S. Cyber Consequences Unit Special Report on the Cyber Campaign Against Georgia has been referenced in over 75 books on cyber conflict, highlighted in over 100 news articles and has been discussed in various publications by the Atlantic Council, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the U.S. Department of Defense and many other organizations around the world.

# Research Papers 

## International Conference on Artificial Intelligence
<p align="justify">

</p>

<b>Article Title:</b>  &nbsp; <a href="https://github.com/johnbumgarner/published_articles_and_research_papers/blob/master/ICAI%20Conference/Temporal%20Modeling%20of%20Twitter%20Posting%20Behavior.pdf">Temporal Modeling of Twitter Posting Behavior</a><br>
<b>Year Published:</b> &nbsp; 2014<br>
<b>Synopsis:</b> &nbsp; This paper describes our approach for temporally modeling the posting behavior of users on the Twitter microblogging service. While other researchers have analyzed general trends of Twitter behavior (for instance, few users contribute most of the posts), we instead focus on modeling the temporal behavior of individual users. Specifically, we determine whether we can model the day-of-the-week posting behavior (e.g., this person is a “weekend warrior”) and the within-day posting behavior (e.g., “night owl” or “morning person”) for individuals. This “individual life pattern” analysis is useful for medical and public health applications. For instance, significant deviations from normal behavior might indicate that a person is potentially ill. Our contribution focuses on probabilistically modeling the posting behavior and then using Kullback-Leibler divergence to demonstrate how well the model captures a user’s posting behavior.
